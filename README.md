# Fuel

## Running tests

Fuel's core reconcilation system is written in pure luau, and can be tested by doing

```bash
luau --fflags=LuauInterpolatedStringBaseSupport test.luau
```

## Generating Fuel Roblox instance library

`rbx.lua` is generated from `generate-rbx.ts`. It must be ran with [deno](https://deno.land):

```bash
deno run generate-rbx.ts > rbx.luau; stylua rbx.luau
```

## Building for Roblox

Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.2.1.

To build Fuel as a model run

```bash
rojo build -o "Fuel.rbxm"
```
